// Iterative Bubble Sort
bubbleSort(arr[], n)
{
  for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++)      

     // Last i elements are already in place   
     for (j = 0; j  arr[j+1])
         swap(arr[j], arr[j+1]);
} 


Recursion Idea.

Base Case: If array size is 1, return.
Do One Pass of normal Bubble Sort. This pass fixes last element of current subarray.
Recur for all elements except last of current subarray.

How to implement it recursively?
Recursive Bubble Sort has no performance/implementation advantages, but can be a good question to check oneâ€™s understanding of Bubble Sort and recursion.

If we take a closer look at Bubble Sort algorithm, we can notice that in first pass, we move largest element to end (Assuming sorting in increasing order). In second pass, we move second largest element to second last position and so on.
